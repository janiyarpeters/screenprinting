Screenprinting in the Age of AI
Interested in the ways creation making varies between human and machine, I conducted an observational study at the Berkeley Art Studio to see the ways printmakers conduct their craft and protect their intellecutal property and inspirations. In addition to a report, I've included a journey map of the screen printing process with picutres for reference. If you have any questions, contact janiya_peters@berkeley.edu.
