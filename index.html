  <title>Art Meets Machine: Printmaking in the Age of AI</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Context</h1>
<p>Printmaking is "an artistic process based on the principle of transferring images from a
matrix onto another surface, most often paper or fabric" [1]. The authenticity of the craft is in its
various mediums—including engravings, lithographs, and cloth—and employment of diverse
tools and materials, such as foil and ink. Recently, the advent of AI-generated art (images
produced by Artificial Intelligence) poses challenges to printmakers and artists alike. General
Adversarial Networks (GAN) can now produce images based on existing images, styles,
subjects, and works [2]. These advancements can compromise copyright entitlements held by
human artists, whose work may be used as training data without their permission. AI-generated
is also beginning to compete with artists in real ways, from winning prizes at art fairs to
producing full-length graphic novels</p>
<h1>Research Objectives</h1>
<p>(1) Define and differentiate the conception, materials, tools, processes, and outcomes between printmaking and AI generated imagemaking.</p>
<p>(2) Observe the creative journey and thought process of printmakers.</p>
<p>(3) Explore the "human" and "mechanized" elements of printmaking, and howAI generated image making might facilitate (or hurt) traditional processes.</p>

<h1>Key Terms</h1>
<p><b>Substrate:</b> material onto which final design will be printed (e.g. wood, fabric).</p>
<p><b>Screen:</b> metal frame containing tightly wound thread.</p>
<p><b>Emulsion:</b> film layer that is highly sensitive to light.</p>
<p><b>Exposure unit:</b> machine that emits rays of light through screens.</p>
<p><b>Transfer:</b> the process of imprinting the screen layer onto the substrate using fabric paint.</p>
<h1>Key Findings</h1>
<p> 1. Printmaking is a physically intensive process. Becasue this study took place in a classroom setting, each student
  had their own space to work/clean, as well as communal access to a washbooth station and dark room. I observed that
  printmakers are constantly adapting material and correcting errors as they go: navigating broken screens; dealing with
  failed exposures or underexposed screens; fixing imperfect transfers of design from screen to substrate.
  According to one instructor, an individual wants to have all their materials ready before they start
  so that they don't have to pause mid-process. This form of printmaking takes a minimum of 24 hours accounting for the
  preparation of the screen with emulsion, dark room exposure (several students leave their screens over night), washing and
  rinsing, and final transfer of the design on to substrate. Substrates used in this process were typically fabrics
  (e.g. t-shirt, dresses, tote bags). This timeline does not account for the creation of the intellectual property, or design,
  dedicated to final use. Creating the design and drawing it on stencil can vary in time depending on the creator and desired goal.
</p>
<p> 2. Printmaking, in this studio observation, is a highly human task but which requires several
machinery and/or mechanized processes to achieve a single finished product,including a hinge board for holding the screen in place
and exposure unit for applying light to the screen and stencil. In the exposure unit process, the stencil with the design sits on top of the
exposure unit, and the screen sits on top of the stencil. The light from the exposure unit hits the screen in all the areas <bold>not</bold> covered
by the marks on the stencil, hardening that area. This process takes maximum two minutes for which students should be patient and careful to let
in outside light. After the "exposure" is done, students leave the screen under a black cover in the dark room, letting it sit for a night.


<p> There is an assumption that traditional, more physical forms of artmaking are not as "mechanized," or pale in sophistication/standardization,
   to emergent digital programs. This is not true. Printmaking uses many different machines (exposure units,
t-shirt presses, hinge boards, blow dryers) to conduct their work. Whereas a human might tell an
AI algorithm what they desire (a subject in a particular style) and it does so, the printmaker acts
as the commissioner and the maker; the printmaker has agency over the tools and machines in
use. </p>

<p> 3. Printmaking is a highly independent task, but one that invites collaboration and different
knowledge bases, according to one interviewee. One can build a presence and find community
through websites, social media (Instagram, Tiktok). The Berkeley Art Studio conducts a Holiday
Pop-up Shop every year in the Martin Luther King Jr. Building to showcase and sell the work of
its studio instructors. In-person tabling at events is another way to promote one's work.
</p>

<p>4. Students' channeled various inspirations into their works, including memes, fat and LGBTQ+
content, pets. One student was inspired by his "couch potato" pitbull dog named Tuna. He
employed a pattern book to help him make a patterned border around his dog's head. These
inspirations were unique to each printmaker and highly variable. This contrasts to the
inspirations of AI-generated art: the algorithm has no personal connection with the data, images,
or styles it is asked to produce. It reads, imitates, corrects, imitates, and so on. But AI itself is
not "inspired" by its family pet or a funny meme it shared with its partner. In many
cases, the maker might receive a commission: so their inspiration comes from the client and
they are responsible for the creation/execution of their client's wishes.</p>

<p>5. Printmaking is used for a variety of purposes: anti-war movement, commercial ventures,
museums, commissions. In a presentation on the history of contemporary printmaking, Andy
Warhol's Marilyn Monroe (1967) piece stood out. Even then, individuals were worried about the
ability to reproduce someone's image/likeness for any and whatever use with little legal
protections. There is a persistent theme in this work concerning entitlements. Who owns a
piece of work? Who controls the likeness represented in a piece of work? Given these
questions, it is important to consider how AI selfie apps Lensa retains user submissions and retracts user control, as evident in its Terms of Use.
</p>

<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>It was a pleasure working with the Berkeley Art Studio to complete this ethnography and journey
map. Even the most intensive portions of the screen printing process were enjoyable for
students, as they worked through problems and errors to complete a product they cherished. All
works photographed in the studio were done with the class' permission, and will not be used
beyond this study.
</p>
<p>The advent of AI-generated images poses significant challenges to artists, illustrators, and visual creators.
  General Adversarial Networks (GAN) can produce novel images through a process called Stable Diffusion, which tunes the noise of desired imagery based on references from its training data.
  Several visual creators have challenged the authenticity of Stable Diffusion and the use of their work as training data.
  According to plaintiffs in the DeviantArt lawsuit, Stability AI "reconstructs copies of the training data with maximum accuracy and fidelity" [3].
  This process allows DeviantArt users to produce derivative works, mimicking styles of established artists, thus posing unfair competition.
  DeviantArt counter-frames Stability AI as an algorithmic tool that studies space and color in reference images, but "does not store copied works even in early training."
  In this case, the verdict will hinge evaluations of generative AI based copyright protections, "Fair Use" doctrine, and "transformative use." </p>

<p>The choice to partake in systems that utiize generative AI is, at the moment, a personal choice.
   However, as more programs like Adobe and Clip Studio Paint implement these algorithms into their user service, it will become ifficult
   for users to avoid. I challenge readers to consider the following before "opting in": </p>
<p>"Who controls the reproductions of my likeness?" For what will these reproductions be used in the future?" </p>
<p> "Who retains access to my reference images? Will they be adopted for future uses sans my permission?" </p>
<p> "Is this undermining the time and work of printmakers, illustrators, or other visual creators?" </p>
<p> "Is there a printmaker or artist I might commission in place of generative AI models?" </p>
<p> If interested, there are several ways to support real visual creators, including attributing and
citing works to the correct maker; buying or commissioning works; taking classes at a local
studio; and following creators on social media (retweet, reblog, like the original account.</p>
