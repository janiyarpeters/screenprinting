  <title>Art Meets Machine: Printmaking in the Age of AI</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Context</h1>
<p>Printmaking is "an artistic process based on the principle of transferring images from a
matrix onto another surface, most often paper or fabric."  It is a diverse media practice making
use of unique surfaces to display imagery and communicate messages. Common mediums include paper,
silk, engravings, lithography, and cloth. Printmakers make use of various tools and material, such as foil and ink.
In the 1960s, graphic screen printing exploded as a commercial art form in the form of logos, stickers,
and t-shirts. Andy Warhol’s Marilyn (1967) provided an iconic, multi-color matrix of the eponymous starlet’s image [2].
Warhol’s post-modern experimentation with color and tone was lauded, but also a source of ethical debate.
What legal right does an individual have to their likeness (e.g. accurate representation versus experimentation)?
Do graphic screen prints produce a popular, commodifed aestethic standardized by machines and mechanized productions?
At present, we are still answering these questions with emergent technology in the form of generative AI.</p>

<p>The advent of AI image generators such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL-E and Lensa AI poses challenges to
artists. AI image generators can produce images based on the style, subject and trends of existing images and work.
Evidently, the incorporation of copyrighted material without permissions compromises copyright entitlements, as well as the
time, labor and due compensation of existing artists and creators [3]. AI-generated is also beginning to compete with artists
in real ways, from winning prizes at art fairs to producing full-length graphic novels. </p>

<p> This ethnographic study aims to re-evaluate the the process and outcomes of printmaking in comparison to emergent technology,
  with attention to mechanical assistance, worker agency, and creative outputs. </p>

<h1>Research Objectives</h1>
<p>(1) Define and differentiate the conception, materials, tools, processes, and outcomes between printmaking and AI generated imagemaking.</p>
<p>(2) Observe the creative journey and thought process of printmakers.</p>
<p>(3) Explore the "human" and "mechanized" elements of printmaking, and howAI generated image making might facilitate (or hurt) traditional processes.</p>

<h1>Key Terms</h1>
<p>Substrate : material onto which final design will be printed (e.g. wood, fabric).</p>
<p>Screen: metal frame containing tightly wound thread.</p>
<p>Emulsion: film layer that is highly sensitive to light.</p>
<p>Exposure unit: machine that emits rays of light through screens.</p>
<p>Transfer: the process of imprinting the screen layer onto the substrate using fabric paint.</p>
<h1>Key Findings</h1>
<p> 1. Printmaking is a physically intensive process. Printmakers are adapting material and correcting errors as they go; navigating broken screens; dealing with failed exposures or
underexposed screens; fixing imperfect transfers of design from screen to substrate. According to one instructor, an individual wants to have all their materials ready so they don't have to
pause the process; printmaking takes a minimum of 24 hours, not counting the creation of the artwork.
</p>
<p> 2. Printmaking, in this studio observation, is a highly human task which requires several
machinery and processes to achieve a single finished product (e.g. t-shirt). See Journey Map for
tools and processes. The human is responsible for both the inspiration and the
creation/execution of that inspiration (e.g. a t-shirt with an image of one's dog on it). In many
cases, the maker might receive a commission: so their inspiration comes from the client and
they are responsible for the creation/execution of their client's wishes.

<p> There is an assumption that traditional, human art forms are not "mechanized" or
unsophisticated; this is not true. Printmaking uses many different machines (exposure units,
t-shirt presses, hinge boards, blow dryers) to conduct their work. Whereas a human might tell an
AI algorithm what they desire (a subject in a particular style) and it does so, the printmaker acts
as the commissioner and the maker; the printmaker has agency over the tools and machines in
use. </p>

<p> 3. Printmaking is a highly independent task, but one that invites collaboration and different
knowledge bases, according to one interviewee. One can build a presence and find community
through websites, social media (Instagram, Tiktok). The Berkeley Art Studio conducts a Holiday
Pop-up Shop every year in the Martin Luther King Jr. Building to showcase and sell the work of
its studio instructors. In-person tabling at events is another way to promote one's work.
</p>

<p>4. Students' channeled various inspirations into their works, including memes, fat and LGBTQ+
content, pets. One student was inspired by his "couch potato" pitbull dog named Tuna. He
employed a pattern book to help him make a patterned border around his dog's head. These
inspirations were unique to each printmaker and highly variable. This contrasts to the
inspirations of AI-generated art: the algorithm has no personal connection with the data, images,
or styles it is asked to produce. It reads, imitates, corrects, imitates, and so on. But AI itself is
not "inspired" by its family pet or a funny meme it shared with its partner</p>

<p>5. Printmaking is used for a variety of purposes: anti-war movement, commercial ventures,
museums, commissions. In a presentation on the history of contemporary printmaking, Andy
Warhol's Marilyn Monroe piece stood out. Even then, individuals were worried about the
ability to reproduce someone's image/likeness for any and whatever use with little legal
protections. There is a persistent theme in this work concerning entitlements. Who owns a
piece of work? Who controls the likeness represented in a piece of work?

I consider these questions with respect to AI image generators. AI selfie app Lensa retains user submissions
and retracts user control, as evident in its Terms of Use. Moreover, Adobe's Content Analysis
function (default: opt-in) allows the service to analyze users' work using machine learning procedures; Adobe already
has two generative AI services via Adobe Firefly (released 2023) and Adobe Sensei (released 2016). In practice,
users of these services commit their likeness or work to a particular personal use; but services recommit these images for other purposes
the user may not be aware of.

<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>It was a pleasure working with the Berkeley Art Studio to complete this ethnography and journey
map. Even the most intensive portions of the screen printing process were enjoyable for
students, as they worked through problems and errors to complete a product they cherished. All
works photographed in the studio were done with the class' permission, and will not be used
beyond this study.
